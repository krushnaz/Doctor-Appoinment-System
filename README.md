Key Achievements:

Successfully developed and implemented a user-friendly Doctor Appointment System that simplified the process of booking appointments and managing patient records

The system received positive feedback from the academic community, and the project was presented at a college-level technology event

Technologies Used:

HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for front-end development
JavaScript for client-side validation
PHP for server-side scripting
MySQL for database management

This project helped me enhance my technical skills, including proficiency in web development technologies and software engineering principles. Additionally, I gained valuable experience in project management, teamwork, and communication while working on this project.
